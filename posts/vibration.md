The Vibration API currently exists as a W3C Candidate Recommendation and has limited support on browsers and devices. While there is a Webkit implimentation of the API, no major Webkit vendors have yet to impliment support for the feature. Firefox and Firefox for Mobile provide support for the API but with a slightly differing implimentation from the current draft.
